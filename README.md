### Model Storage
The TTS models are automatically downloaded and cached locally:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/tts`
- **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\tts`
- **Linux**: `~/.cache/tts`

Models are downloaded only once and work completely offline afterward.

### Security & Updates
- Models are downloaded securely through Coqui TTS's API
- Downloads are verified for integrity
- Models are cached locally for offline use
- Updates can be forced by clearing the cache directory

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- 🐍 Python 3.10 or higher
- 📦 Poetry (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd DialogDuoTTS
   ```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. Set up pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   poetry run pre-commit install
   ```

## 📝 Usage

### Basic Usage 🔰

1. Create a conversation file in `data/conversation.txt` with the following format:
   ```
   PersonA: Hello, how are you?
   PersonB: I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?
   PersonA: Great, thanks for asking!
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   poetry run python main.py
   ```

3. Find your generated audio files in the `output/` directory! 🎉

### Command-Line Options 🛠️

The script supports several command-line options for flexibility:

```bash
# Use a custom input file
poetry run python main.py -i path/to/your/dialogue.txt

# Show verbose output
poetry run python main.py -v

# Combine options
poetry run python main.py -i custom_dialogue.txt -v
```

Available options:
- `-i, --input`: Specify the input text file path (default: data/conversation.txt)
- `-v, --verbose`: Show detailed output during processing

### Example Workflows 📋

1. **Using the Default Configuration** 🔄:
   ```bash
   poetry run python main.py
   ```
   This will process `data/conversation.txt` and create an audio file in the `output/` directory.

2. **Processing a Custom Dialogue** 📝:
   ```bash
   poetry run python main.py -i data/project_podcast.txt
   ```
   This will process your custom dialogue file and create an audio file with a timestamp.

3. **Debug Mode with Verbose Output** 🔍:
   ```bash
   poetry run python main.py -i custom_dialogue.txt -v
   ```
   This will show detailed information about the conversion process, useful for troubleshooting.

## 👩‍💻 Development

### 🛠️ Code Quality Tools

We use industry-standard tools to maintain high code quality:

- **black**: Code formatting
- **isort**: Import sorting
- **flake8**: Style guide enforcement
- **mypy**: Static type checking
- **pylint**: Code analysis

These tools run automatically as pre-commit hooks when you commit changes.

### 🧪 Running Tests

Run the test suite using:
```bash
poetry run python -m unittest discover tests
```

### ✅ Type Checking

Run static type checking with:
```bash
poetry run mypy .
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

1. Model Download Issues:
   - Ensure you have internet connection for the first run
   - Models are downloaded from Coqui TTS's HuggingFace repository
   - Each model is approximately 100MB
   - Check your disk space (need ~200MB for both models)
   - Models are cached at:
     - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/tts`
     - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\tts`
     - Linux: `~/.cache/tts`

2. Audio Quality Issues:
   - Try using a different speaker ID from the VCTK dataset
   - Adjust the synthesis parameters in the code
   - Ensure the input text is properly formatted
   - Check if the audio file is not corrupted

3. Permission Issues:
   - Ensure you have write permissions in the output directory
   - Check that the TTS cache directory is accessible
   - Try running with elevated permissions if needed
